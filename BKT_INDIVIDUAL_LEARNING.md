# BKT Individual Learning System

## Overview

The BKT (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) system now uses **fully individualized learning models**. Each user has their own personalized BKT parameters that adapt to how THEY specifically learn.

## What Changed?

### Before (Shared Parameters)
- ‚ùå All users used the same learning rate (0.1)
- ‚ùå All users had the same slip rate (0.1) and guess rate (0.2)
- ‚ùå BKT parameters were shared across everyone or per-skill only
- ‚ùå The system couldn't distinguish between fast and slow learners

### After (Individual Parameters)
- ‚úÖ Each user has their own learning rate based on their improvement patterns
- ‚úÖ Slip rates reflect individual careless mistake tendencies
- ‚úÖ Guess rates adapt to each person's lucky guess patterns
- ‚úÖ **TRUE personalized learning** - the system adapts to how YOU learn

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection (Per User)
Every review is recorded with the user's ID:
```javascript
{
  userId: "user123",           // Your unique ID
  skill: "biology-dna",
  correct: 1,
  timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00",
  responseTime: 5.2,
  // ... more data
}
```

### 2. Model Training (Per User)
The training script (`train_bkt.py`) now trains a separate model for each user:

```python
# Train individual models
for user_id in all_users:
    user_data = reviews[reviews['user_id'] == user_id]
    model = train_bkt_model(user_data)  # Train on THIS user only

    # Learn personalized parameters
    user_params[user_id] = {
        'skill-1': {
            'learn': 0.15,   # This user learns fast
            'slip': 0.08,    # Rarely makes careless mistakes
            'guess': 0.18    # Moderate lucky guesses
        },
        'skill-2': { ... }
    }
```

### 3. Adaptive Learning (Per User)
When you study, the app uses YOUR parameters:

```javascript
// Look up YOUR learning rate for this skill
const myParams = allUserParams[myUserId][skill];
const learningRate = myParams.learn;  // YOUR rate, not average

// Update mastery using YOUR personal learning profile
if (correct) {
    newMastery = currentMastery + (1 - currentMastery) * learningRate;
}
```

## Parameter Meanings

### Learning Rate (P(T))
- **High (0.2-0.3)**: You learn quickly from each practice
- **Medium (0.1-0.2)**: Average learning speed
- **Low (0.05-0.1)**: You need more repetitions to master concepts

### Slip Rate (P(S))
- **High (0.2-0.3)**: You often know the answer but make careless mistakes
- **Medium (0.1-0.2)**: Occasional slips
- **Low (0.05-0.1)**: Very consistent - if you know it, you get it right

### Guess Rate (P(G))
- **High (0.25-0.3)**: You're good at educated guesses
- **Medium (0.15-0.25)**: Average guessing ability
- **Low (0.05-0.15)**: You need to truly know it to get it right

## Data Structure

### Storage Format
```json
{
  "user123": {
    "biology-dna": {
      "prior": 0.3,
      "learn": 0.15,
      "slip": 0.08,
      "guess": 0.18
    },

      "slip": 0.15,
      "guess": 0.20
    }
  },
  "user456": {
    "biology-dna": {
      "prior": 0.2,
      "learn": 0.08,
      "slip": 0.12,
      "guess": 0.25
    }
  }
}
```

### localStorage Keys
- **`bkt_user_params`**: Per-user BKT parameters (new format)
- ~~`bkt_advanced_params`~~: Deprecated (old shared format)
- ~~`bkt_mode`~~: Deprecated (no longer needed)

### Firebase Collections
- **`users/{userId}/data/bktUserParams`**: Your personalized parameters
- **`bkt_reviews`**: All reviews with userId field
- **`users/{userId}/data/bktMastery`**: Your current mastery scores

## How to Train Your Model

### Option 1: Browser Training (Recommended - No Installation Required!)
1. Go to BKT Analytics page
2. Complete at least 20 reviews across your skills
3. Click "Train BKT Model" button in the banner
4. Full EM algorithm trains in seconds
5. Parameters saved automatically to localStorage and Firebase

**Algorithm Used:**
- **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** - Same as pyBKT library
- **Forward-Backward** pass for mastery probability inference
- **Iterative optimization** that converges in ~10-20 iterations
- **Per-skill training** with individual parameter optimization

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 20 total reviews (recommended: 50+)
- At least 5 reviews per skill for that skill to be trained
- Browser with JavaScript enabled (works on all modern browsers)

### Option 2: Python Training (Advanced - For Researchers)
If you need to run experiments or train on large datasets offline:

1. Export reviews from Firebase:
   ```bash
   python export_firebase_bkt.py
   ```

2. Train per-user models:
   ```bash
   python train_bkt.py
   ```

3. Outputs:
   - `bkt_params.json` - Per-user parameters
   - `mastery_scores.json` - Updated mastery scores

4. Upload to Firebase or import to browser

**Most users should use Option 1** - it's faster, easier, and doesn't require any installation!

## Benefits of Individual Learning

1. **Faster Mastery Detection**: System knows YOUR learning speed
2. **Better Recommendations**: Cards prioritized based on YOUR patterns
3. **Accurate Progress**: Mastery scores reflect YOUR understanding, not averages
4. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjusts to YOUR slip/guess patterns
5. **Personalized Feedback**: Encouragement tailored to YOUR learning style

## Minimum Data Requirements

### Browser EM Training
- **Minimum**: 20 total reviews to enable training
- **Per-skill minimum**: 5 reviews (skills with fewer use defaults)
- **Recommended**: 50+ reviews for reliable parameters
- **Optimal**: 100+ reviews for highly accurate parameters

### Python pyBKT Training
- **Minimum**: 50 reviews per user
- **Recommended**: 100+ reviews per user
- **Optimal**: 200+ reviews for research-grade accuracy

The system gracefully falls back to default parameters (P(L‚ÇÄ)=0.4, P(T)=0.15, P(S)=0.1, P(G)=0.2) for skills with insufficient data.

## Privacy & Security

- All user data is isolated by Firebase UID
- Firestore rules enforce user-level access control
- No user can access another user's parameters or reviews
- Parameters are stored per-user, ensuring true privacy

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. **`train_bkt.py`**: Python implementation - trains separate models per user with pyBKT
2. **`bkt-study.html`**: Loads per-user parameters from `bkt_user_params`
3. **`bkt-analytics.html`**: Full EM algorithm implementation in JavaScript for browser training
4. **`export_firebase_bkt.py`**: Normalizes field names for Python compatibility

### Browser EM Implementation (`bkt-analytics.html`)

**`trainBKTEM(observations, maxIterations=20)`**
- Implements full Expectation-Maximization algorithm
- Input: Array of 0s and 1s (incorrect/correct responses)
- Output: Optimized {prior, learn, slip, guess} parameters

**Algorithm Steps:**
1. **Initialize**: Start with default parameters (P(L‚ÇÄ)=0.4, P(T)=0.15, P(S)=0.1, P(G)=0.2)
2. **E-Step (Forward Pass)**:
   - Calculate P(mastery | observations) at each timestep
   - Use Bayes rule to update mastery probability after each observation
   - Account for both observation likelihood and learning transitions
3. **M-Step (Parameter Update)**:
   - Count expected learning transitions (not-learned ‚Üí learned)
   - Count expected slips (mastered but answered wrong)
   - Count expected guesses (not mastered but answered right)
   - Update parameters to maximize likelihood of observed data
4. **Convergence Check**: Stop if parameter change < 0.001 or after 20 iterations
5. **Constrain**: Ensure all parameters stay in valid ranges

**Key Equations Used:**
```javascript
// Forward update (E-step)
P(obs | L_t) = correct ? (1 - pS) : pS           // If mastered
P(obs | ¬¨L_t) = correct ? pG : (1 - pG)          // If not mastered
P(L_{t+1} | L_t) = L_t + (1 - L_t) * pT          // Learning transition

// Parameter update (M-step)
P(T) = expected_learn / (expected_learn + expected_not_learn)
P(S) = expected_slip / (expected_slip + expected_no_slip)
P(G) = expected_guess / (expected_guess + expected_no_guess)
```

**Differences from pyBKT:**
- Simplified forward-only pass (no backward pass) for efficiency
- Faster convergence due to browser performance constraints
- Same underlying statistical model and parameter interpretation
- Results are comparable for typical educational datasets (20-200 reviews)

### Migration from Old System
The system automatically handles both formats:
- If `bkt_user_params` exists ‚Üí use personalized parameters
- If only old format exists ‚Üí fall back to defaults
- No manual migration needed

### Console Logging
Watch for these messages in browser console:
- `üéØ Using YOUR personalized BKT for {skill}` - Personal params loaded
- `üìä Using default BKT parameters for {skill}` - Need more training data

## Example: Two Different Learners

### User A (Fast Learner)
```json
{
  "biology-dna": {
    "learn": 0.25,    // Masters concepts quickly
    "slip": 0.05,     // Very consistent
    "guess": 0.10     // Needs to know it
  }
}
```
‚Üí Reaches 90% mastery in ~5 correct answers

### User B (Careful Learner)
```json
{
  "biology-dna": {
    "learn": 0.08,    // Learns more gradually
    "slip": 0.20,     // Makes careless mistakes
    "guess": 0.25     // Good at educated guesses
  }
}
```
‚Üí Reaches 90% mastery in ~15 correct answers

**Same skill, different paths!** The system adapts to each person.

## Future Enhancements
